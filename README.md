# Dotfiles

## Install

```
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
./bin/bootstrap.sh
```

## Local Fish Config

If there's customization you want Fish to load on startup that is specific to 
your machine (stuff you don't want to commit into the repo), after running `./bin/bootstrap.sh` open `~/.env.fish`
and put it all in there. It will be loaded near the top of `fish/config.fish`.
